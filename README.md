# ðŸš€ Any Node Python

This node was inspired by AnyNode.
I wanted to have a node where I can paste any python script and execute it.
That way I can use this node in combination with a Custom node like the Ollama node that can generate the python code and feed into this node. This also makes it much easier to debug or modify the code iteratively.

As of the current version, I've created separate nodes for no input, 1 input and 2 inputs. The input also currently takes only sting as input.

Let me know in the discussion how you would use this node.
